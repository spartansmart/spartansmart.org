    <h2>What Is Spartan SMART?</h2>
    <p>
      Spartan SMART is a community-based, faith-based released time Bible education outreach
      serving students in the Richmond Heights Local School District. With written parental
      permission, students are released during the school day to attend off-campus Bible
      instruction focused on faith development, character formation, and biblical understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spartan SMART is the local expression of the broader SMART ministry and is tailored
      specifically to the Richmond Heights community and school schedule.
